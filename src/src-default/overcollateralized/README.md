# #8 Overcollateralized

There's a lending pool for borrowing Defi Ctf Tokens, where you first have to deposit twice the borrow amount in ETH as collateral. The pool has 100,000 DefiCtfTokens in liquidity.

There's a DefiCtfToken market in an Uniswap v1 exchange, currently with 10 ETH and 10 DefiCtfToken in liquidity.

Starting with 25 ETH and 1000 DefiCtfTokens, you must steal all tokens from the lending pool.
