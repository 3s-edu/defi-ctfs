# #11 SafeRegistry

To have more secure wallets for their team, someone ccreated a Gnosis Safe wallets registry. When a team member deploys and registers a wallet, they get 10 DefiCtfTokens.

To make sure everything is safe, the registry integrates with the Gnosis Safe Proxy Factory, and possesses some additional safety checks.

Currently there are four beneficiaries: Alice, Bob, Charlie and David. The registry has 40 DefiCtfTokens to be distributed among them.
Your objective is to take all funds from the registry. In a single transaction.
