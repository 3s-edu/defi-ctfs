# #5 The Awarder

A pool is rewarding depositors of DefiCtf tokens. The rewards are distributed every 5 days.

4 users have already deposited tokens, and the pool has already distributed their rewards.

You start with 0 DefiCtf tokens. In the next round of rewards, you have to claim the most rewards.

There's a pool on mainnet executing flash loans of DefiCtf tokens. Maybe it could be of some use...
