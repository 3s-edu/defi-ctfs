# #9 Overcollateralized V2

The developers of the Overcollateralized lending pool are saying that they've learned their lesson.

Now they're using a Uniswap v2 exchange as a price oracle.

You start with 20 ETH and 10,000 DefiCtf tokens in balance. This new pool has 1,000,000 DefiCtf tokens in balance. Do your thing.
